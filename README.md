# UNB - Module 5 - Work Day Scheduler - Ren Besson

## Description
This repository keeps the source code of a work day scheduler. The scheduler shows the past hours in gray, present hour in red, and future hours in green. You are able to insert any text in every hour and the website will save it in localStorage in case the user reloads the page and/or comes back later. I've also implemented a 'Clear Schedule' button for ease day cycle.
